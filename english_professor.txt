The literature of the 20th century offers powerful warnings about the dangers of uncontrolled technological advancement and the misuse of artificial intelligence. George Orwell's 1984 (published in 1949) portrays a totalitarian regime where surveillance, censorship, and psychological manipulation reduce individuality to nothing. The concept of "Big Brother" remains one of the most recognized symbols of state control and loss of personal freedom.
Isaac Asimov, in his I, Robot collection (1950), explored ethical dilemmas arising from intelligent machines. He introduced the famous Three Laws of Robotics, attempting to prevent robots from harming humans. Yet, Asimov's stories show that even well-intentioned rules can have unintended and dangerous consequences. Literature serves as a cultural lens, warning us that rapid technological progress without ethical consideration can lead to catastrophic outcomes, manipulation, and societal control.
Additionally, dystopian literature continues to question the balance between human autonomy and technological dominance. Authors such as Aldous Huxley in Brave New World further depict futures where comfort and stability are achieved at the expense of individuality and freedom. These cautionary tales remind society of the critical importance of regulating technological advancements to protect human values and rights.
